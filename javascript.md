## HTTP Request in Javascript
   Making HTTP calls from the client-side wasn’t that easy a decade ago. A front-end developer would have to rely on XMLHttpRequest  which was hard to use and implement. The modern libraries and HTTP clients make the front-end features like user interactions, animations, asynchronous file uploads, etc., easier. 
  
  1. **AJAX** is a set of web development techniques used by client-side frameworks and libraries to make asynchronous HTTP calls to the server.
  2. **JQuery**.
  3. **Fetch API** -- new in ES6 uses promises.
  4. **Axios** -- is an open source library for making HTTP requests and provides many great features.
  5. **HttpModuleClient** -- Angular has its own  HTTP module that works with Angular apps. 
      It uses the RxJS library to handle asynchronous requests and provides many options to perform the HTTP requests.
  6. **SuperAgent** is a lightweight and progressive AJAX library that’s focused more on readability and flexibility.
  7.  **Request** - A Simplified HTTP Client.
      The Request library is one of the simplest ways to make HTTP calls. 
      The structure and   syntax are very similar to that of  how requests are handled in Node.js
